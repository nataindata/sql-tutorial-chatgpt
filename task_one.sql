-- To finish a class, students must pass four exams (exam ids: 1,2,3 and 4).
-- Given a table `exam_scores` containing the data about all of the exams that students took,
-- form a new table to track the scores for each student.
-- *Note: Students took each exam only once.*
--
-- **Example:**
-- For the given input:

| student_id | student_name | exam_id | score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | Anna | 1 | 71 |
| 100 | Anna | 2 | 72 |
| 100 | Anna | 3 | 73 |
| 100 | Anna | 4 | 74 |
| 101 | Brian | 1 | 65 |

the expected output should be:

| student_name | exam_1 | exam_2 | exam_3 | exam_4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anna | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 |
| Brian | 65 | NULL | NULL | NULL |

**Input:**

`exam_scores` table

| Column | Type |
| --- | --- |
| student_id | INTEGER |
| student_name | VARCHAR |
| exam_id | INTEGER |
| score | INTEGER |

**Output:**

| Column | Type |
| --- | --- |
| student_name | VARCHAR |
| exam_1 | INT |
| exam_2 | INT |
| exam_3 | INT |
| exam_4 | INT |
